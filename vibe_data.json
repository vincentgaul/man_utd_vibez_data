{"hourly": {"vibe_word": "Disgruntled", "vibe_score": 3, "summary": "Fans are frustrated with Manchester United's inconsistency and managerial instability, highlighted by Thomas Frank's sacking rumors and Ruben Amorim's failed tenure. The mood isn't helped by a viral fan's agonizing quest for 5 consecutive wins (ending in a draw vs. West Ham) and Wayne Rooney mocking the saga. There's sarcasm about priorities ('Elvis Might >>> Frank Sacked'), but a rare positive note on Michael Carrick's influence offers fleeting hope."}, "daily": {"vibe_word": "Resigned", "vibe_score": 5, "summary": "Fan sentiment shifted from cautious optimism (hoping for a fifth straight win) to frustration and resignation following a draw with West Ham. Early excitement about form and potential signings gave way to anger over defensive errors and wasted chances, though Benjamin \u0160e\u0161ko's late goal provided a glimmer of hope. The overarching trend shows a decline from hopefulness to disappointment, tempered by dry humor and reluctant acceptance of the unbeaten run continuing."}, "weekly": {"vibe_word": "optimistic", "vibe_score": 7, "summary": "Fan sentiment showed a clear upward trajectory across the week, shifting from concerned frustration early in the period (Feb 2-3) to steadily growing optimism fueled by a four-game winning streak under Michael Carrick and standout performances from young players. Persistent concerns about transfers and squad depth were gradually outweighed by late-week euphoria around Champions League prospects and Carrick's potential permanent appointment."}}
