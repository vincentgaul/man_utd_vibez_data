{"hourly": {"vibe_word": "Cautious", "vibe_score": 6, "summary": "Manchester United fans are cautiously optimistic after a late Benjamin Sesko equalizer salvaged a draw against West Ham, maintaining their unbeaten run under Carrick. Frustration lingers over dropping points to a defensive side and recurring 'karma' jokes about a fan delaying a haircut until United win. The vibe is resilient but tinged with typical theatre-of-dreams dramatics."}, "daily": {"vibe_word": "Resigned", "vibe_score": 5, "summary": "Fan sentiment shifted from cautious optimism (hoping for a fifth straight win) to frustration and resignation following a draw with West Ham. Early excitement about form and potential signings gave way to anger over defensive errors and wasted chances, though Benjamin \u0160e\u0161ko's late goal provided a glimmer of hope. The overarching trend shows a decline from hopefulness to disappointment, tempered by dry humor and reluctant acceptance of the unbeaten run continuing."}, "weekly": {"vibe_word": "optimistic", "vibe_score": 7, "summary": "Fan sentiment showed a clear upward trajectory across the week, shifting from concerned frustration early in the period (Feb 2-3) to steadily growing optimism fueled by a four-game winning streak under Michael Carrick and standout performances from young players. Persistent concerns about transfers and squad depth were gradually outweighed by late-week euphoria around Champions League prospects and Carrick's potential permanent appointment."}}
