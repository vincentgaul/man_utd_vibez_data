Early excitement about form and potential signings gave way to anger over defensive errors and wasted chances, though Benjamin \u0160e\u0161ko's late goal provided a glimmer of hope. The overarching trend shows a decline from hopefulness to disappointment, tempered by dry humor and reluctant acceptance of the unbeaten run continuing."}, "weekly": {"vibe_word": "optimistic", "vibe_score": 7, "summary": "Fan sentiment showed a clear upward trajectory across the week, shifting from concerned frustration early in the period (Feb 2-3) to steadily growing optimism fueled by a four-game winning streak under Michael Carrick and standout performances from young players.
